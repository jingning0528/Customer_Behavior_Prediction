Bought a car elsewhere,"Saab is getting to old, wants to get into something new.","4PM CALL TODAY > Victoria is currently rate shopping. She was in touch with another Subaru Dealership and has been pricing out CrossTreks but has been overwhelmed with car shopping anxiety, they quoted her too high so she is not interested (over 600/ month on a 60 month term) She is ready to buy and take delivery, she just needs someone to reassure her, hold her hand through the deal and be transparent. Her requirements are:  Less than $500/month or $250 biweekly. Brand new or super low km used AWD Hatchback Subaru with a roof rails installed already (Crosstrek is #1 choice, Outback is #2 choice). She is planning on owning this car for the next 10 years minimum so the term of the finance doesn't matter to her at all, she would actually prefer as long as possible with whatever interest rate is applicable. Monthly payment is the bottom line. She is in good credit standing. While she resides in Barry, she routinely drives all over the province when she is not working from home. She said up to 600kms/ week is average. The majority of her trips are over to Killarney. She is very active outdoors with her time off and has several kayaks and canoes that she takes around. This deal would be a remote deal in which she would take delivery in Barrie or head down to you guys once the deal has been made to trade in her Saab. Ordering new is #1 priority but I also showed her the 2019 Outback on your lot (Stock # K3332223) and she also said that looks great since she could get a Limited for about the same as a CrossTrek Touring.

He is not to fussy with options and said ""i don't care about leather seats and all that"" so bells and whistles are nice but not as important to him as performance and warranties. He would be using the vehicle as a work truck and personal truck every day which is why his current truck has so many km.

He was not happy with the 28k he was presented by a different dealership he decided to not work with (used lot had no new vehicles apparently) He prefers near new used but ultimately needs to lower his monthly payment if possible. needs to lower his gas costs of over $250/week as he drives quite a bit. He also has $3000 in credit cards he mentioned is another monthly financial burden. He is trying to lower his current monthly cost of ownership and doesn't fully understand how this all works even after clarifying.

Lost,Looking to replace current vehicle.,"Josh will be the primary driver for this vehicle. He was specifically looking for a Kia Optima. At this point in the car searching process, Josh feels he's very early and was checking out prices. We came across the 2018 Kia Optima listing at Lethbridge Kia where it says ""Contact for Price"". Josh is interested in hearing what price the Optima is being sold for. Ideally, he would like a hybrid if available. For this purchase (NonHybrid), he is looking to stick to a budget of $10,000 to $20,000 and would like to pay in CASH. Josh isn't too keen on doing a testdrive at the moment but will likely testdrive vehicles in December/January. The Kia Optima is his top option at the moment and will likely stop by Lethbridge Kia in the next couple of months. The phone appointment is set for Tuesday, Nov. 16 at 6:15PM. Please let him know what pricing on the 2018 Kia Optima is and what the Hybrid version of the Optima is going for these days. Please contact him only after 6:00PM.",Registered Psychologist,

Ghosting,C43  anniversary coming up C43 is the gift. A class wants an A class for her business,"Amy is looking for two cars.   The first and most important is a C43 AMG. Her budget is around 450 biweekly with $5000 down. The car is an anniversary gift for her partner so they can have matching vehicles for their anniversary in early February. The car purchase would need to be sooner so the vehicle is secured. She mentioned her partner wants the coupe specifically, as new as possible while staying in budget. She also mentioned that she wants some type of red accent (seats, stitching, callipers) and black rims but is open to getting the rims wrapped and that is not a dealbreaker. She hopes the car is under 60k but payment budget is more important. If no C43 is available she has considered other similar AMG models but really really wants a C43. She likes the one you have on the lot right now (P5090A) but would really prefer a coupe.  The second vehicle she is interested in is the A Class hatch for lease or finance. She would want a city driver with some storage for daily use as well as for business purposes for under 50k. The A class is less of an urgent buy but she is absolutely in the market. She hasn't explored many options because she has been focused on the C43 and wants more information, possibly a test drive.

,Wants to replace her current car as it is getting old and having trouble commuting,"Jamey is very excited to start shopping for her first ""real car."" Now that she is employed she can afford to get something nicer than the 09 Sonota. She does like her current car but wants to trade it in for a new or as new as possible car. She really likes the value that Mazda brings and thinks the Mazda 3 would be a fantastic option.

,Looking to buy a minivan for her daughters dog walking business.,"Tara is looking to purchase a minivan in cash for her daughter. She is on a very very tight budget and needs to keep the car under $10,000 all in. She has been searching for a very long time and  has had no luck due to the price of used vehicles lately. She needs to have the back seats removable since there will be as many as 10 dogs in the car at a time. This will be a vehicle for the next year as their business scales and expands. Right now there is not enough cash flow for anything else. She is located in Victoria but is more than willing to come to Vancouver because this is the very first vehicle she has seen that will fit her daughters needs that is below 200k kms and less than $10,000. Since she is in Victoria, she would like a call as soon as possible with information pertaining to the history of the minivan as well as what it would look like to remove the back seats to allow more space for the dogs.
