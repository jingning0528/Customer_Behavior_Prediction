But after further conversation he is willing to push that budget to $400 MONTHLY. After showing him several options, the Kia Niro was the best option for him to consider as it as all the features he's looking for + a clean CarFax. His only issue is that he believes the Kia Niro to be TOO SMALL. Because of this, he is NOT LOCKED IN to the KIA NIRO whatsoever and would like to hear other potential options for him.

Bought a car elsewhere,Wife is getting her full license soon and needs a vehicle to get to patients!,Issac and his wife are shopping for a lowbudget AWD vehicle. His wife is a nurse and often has to go to patients' houses for visits/elderly care. Their first priority is AWD to handle the wintertime. Their second priority is budget. They will be cosinging on the loan but are in the 'okay' credit range. He said his score is somewhere around 600. He currently has a car loan with a small amount remaining. He will be keeping his vehicle. They were originally looking for an SUV but she has trouble with large vehicles so were super excited when we let them know that sedans can sometimes come in AWD. From there it was a matter of finding something that will fit their $250/month budget.

,"The 1500 is not cutting it, needs towing capacity of the 3500","VERY DETAILED, PLEASE REVIEW Christa and her husband are currently in the middle of moving to Rocky Mountain House from Prince George. They are moving for two reasons, 1) Christa's family lives in RMH and her father has fallen ill. 2) Their business is rapidly expanding and the move is strategic. Their current truck is a 1500 and it does not do what they need it to any longer. He regularly hauls pumps and goes to remote sites to service tank farms. They would like to expand to use a gooseneck trailer and are wanting up to 12,000lbs capacity. Since they own the business they want to consider lease options before financing for the writeoff. But this is an option they are still exploring since they are relatively new to the truck and oil world. Their business income is between 18k25k per month. He currently has two cars under his name and she has none. She may purchase the truck through her own name or the business, whichever is more beneficial. I recommended the 3500HD, unsure if they need a dually or not. This is where your expertise will come into play, they really need a guiding hand. They are moving next month and want all of this set up for when they arrive. Their dealbreakers are   leather seats, 1012k lbs towing capacity, long box, crew cab or a mega cab, towing package.

,"Late husbands truck is too big for her, her SUV doesnt handle the roads","Cindy is a very sweet older woman who has had a very difficult year. Her husband passed away in September and she has taken custody of her granddaughter. She lives in between Lundar and Eriksdale meaning the roads can get really bad in the wintertime.

Future prospect,Tired of the old Mercedes and is ready for an upgrade!,"Jenny use to be a high class mortgage broker and needed her vehicle to match her position and lifestyle! She is now retired and doesn't love Mercedesbenz like she use to (reliability issues, lack of consistent craftsmanship throughout the brand). She does love the size, weight and luxurious comfort it offers and is not ready to part with those aspects of her S class. My first thought was Genesis and at first she wasn't sure of Genesis due to it being a Korean car brand, and the stigma behind these manufacturers from the last few decades. I explained how far Hyundai/Kia has come and how Genesis was born. I touched on the fact that the designer responsible for the Bentley Bentayga assisted in the creation of the Genesis lineup. She may consider a G80, but knowing that the G90 is a direct competitor to the S class and offers the three things she loves so much I think this really will be the best option for her to consider. Jenny is now excited to come see a Genesis in person and to learn more about what they have to offer! She was thinking of paying cash, but may be open to discuss other options.

We discussed market inflation, the benefits of financing a vehicle on an auto loan, and a few other things regarding what was most important to her for the next vehicle.  She concluded reliability and low KM's is by far the most important thing. Which is more of a reason to finance something a bit more expensive and she agreed!  She likes the idea of financing because it allows her to expand her budget and not be required to come up with a lump sum of cash all at once.   She may need a cosigner due to her only being employed at her job for 1 month, family in town that can potentially support a cosigner would like to try on her own.

Future prospect,Lease is up and she needs to get into a new vehicle before Saturday!,"Lea came to us unsure of what her next vehicle would be. She didn't have the best experience with VW and doesn't want another one. She is looking to downsize from the 6 seater, and did not want to sacrifice the comfort and luxury the Atlas Highline offered. I introduced her to the redesigned Rogue and she was hooked right away. She likes the modern and updated interior and leather(nicer than the Atlas)which is one of three main selling points for her. A good sound system is also important and the 10 speaker Bose system should be more than enough which was selling point number two. Finally, she wants something with power... I advised her the Rogue is powerful for what it has, however the amount of fuel she will save is far more important and she humbly agreed. She is excited to come in and test drive the vehicle September 1st at 6:20pm right after work. She would prefer a text to confirm her appointment as she will be at work.","LAser technician (20 years, 7 years current position)","camping, hiking, are curious about rooftop tents"

Future prospect,The patriot is getting too old and costly to maintain,"Devin is looking to replace her current vehicle with something much newer and more reliable. She really loves Jeeps and their capabilities. Her dream car is a 4x4 SUV with a leather interior (easy to clean), 5 seats, and a large cargo space for her pupper. The Jeep Compass Trailhawk and the Cherokee Limited are her standouts. She would want to test drive a new Compass and a Cherokee as well as get leasing/financing numbers. Her fallback is a Mazda CX5 and the purpose of heading in is to compare this Mazda to Jeeps and see which is better for her!

She works fulltime in the week, good income, and has a credit score between 650700. She really can't decide between these three without test driving and she will be heading in on Saturday to compare and contrast. She is really ready to get out of her Patriot and the chances of a deal are very high. Please call to confirm with her anytime.

In doing so she is wanting to consolidate her vehicles into one Nissan AWD SUV. She absolutely LOVES Nissan and thinks they are the best.
